Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player paper-and-pencil game, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. It is played on a 3x3 grid, and the players take turns placing their symbol (either an X or an O) on an empty cell. The goal is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all of the cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.

The game was made Using Kotlin on Android studios.
It has 3 activities. First activity is the homepage which shows the description of game. Second activity is where players will enter their names. If players donâ€™t enter their names then default name of Player1 and player2 will be given. The Third activity is where the grid is of 3x3. The players will play one turn at a time and if any player gets 3 in a row then they win else it will be a draw. After the game is over players will have choice to restart the game or go on home page.
